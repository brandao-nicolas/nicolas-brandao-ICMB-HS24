Assignment 1 was to create a [repository](https://github.com/brandao-nicolas/nicolas-brandao-ICMB-HS24) to store my assignments and publish this website featuring a simple plot to verify that everything is working.

## A Simple Plot

For the simple plot, I decided to create a histogram of 1000 generated IQ scores. IQ scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.

```{r}
# Generate a sample of 1000 IQ scores from a normal distribution
# with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15
generated_iq_scores <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 100, sd = 15)

# Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the generated IQ scores
hist(generated_iq_scores,
     main = "Distribution of Generated IQ Scores",
     xlab = "IQ score",
     ylab = "Frequency")
```
