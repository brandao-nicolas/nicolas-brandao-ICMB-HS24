IQ scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Generate a sample of 1000 IQ scores from a normal distribution\n# with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15\ngenerated_iq_scores <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 100, sd = 15)\n\n# Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the generated IQ scores\nhist(generated_iq_scores,\n     main = \"Distribution of Generated IQ Scores\",\n     xlab = \"IQ score\",\n     ylab = \"Frequency\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
